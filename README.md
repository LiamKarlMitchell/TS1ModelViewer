# TS1 Model Viewer

This project is an attempt to parse and view models from Twelve Sky.
Although it might also work with other SOBJECT files.


See issues tagged with [enhancement](https://github.com/LiamKarlMitchell/TS1ModelViewer/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) for a plan of things to come.
### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Three.js] - awesome webgl rendering thing.
* [jbinary] - a way to read / write binary data in browser.
* [jdataview] - a way to specify a view on binary data. Lets us do some complicated structures.

### Installation

Set it up on a web server of some kind.
If desired add an assets directory and symlink it to your game directory.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

If you want to work out file format related things a hex editor and knowldge of 3D file formats would be handy.
There is great info on this around the net.
